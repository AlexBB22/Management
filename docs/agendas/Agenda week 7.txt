# Points of action
Bike reservation:  we have enhanced the way the bike reservation view looks and have also made a full working implementation for the bike reservation, including the restriction that a user can only reserve one bike per day.

Room reservation: The view for the room reservation has been enhanced and is now working well.

Main view: The main view has been enhanced and now also includes the functionality to add to dos.

Ordering food: A great progress has been made for ordering food, the UI now looks really good and the server side post and get methods have been made.

Admin functionality: The views specific for the admin functionalities have been added as well as the functionality to add buildings/rooms.

# Questions for the TA
1. When is the deadline for the videos and where should they be submitted?
2. Is there a problem if the videos will have different lengths than the ones mentioned in the Mattermost announcement?
3. For next week's deadline, do we have to have the report fully done, or just a draft/outline of what will be included in it?
