# Points of action
    registration:       added UI and working registration. We are able to make new accounts and post them to the database and
                        we keep track of the roles of these users.
    room reservation:   the methods to reserve rooms and post that information to the database have been added (should be connected to UI)
    bike reservation:   same as rooms maybe not connected to UI.

    role:               Niels?
