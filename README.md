## Description of project
This project involved creating an application that allows users to create an account and manage resources of TU Delft. This entails the ability
for a user to reserve rooms, reserve bikes, and order food. A user can select a role ranging from Student, Staff, Teacher and Admin. 
Depending on the role, the user has different functionalities on our application. 

The application follows the MVC design pattern, and uses JavaFX to create client-side views. Moreover, it uses the Spring framework
to create server-side controllers and persistence entities. The server-side connects to a non-local MySQL database that stores
all data.

## How to run it
To run the application, first build the project using Gradle. Once that is done, all required libraries and frameworks will be downloaded.

Next, run MainApp, which can be found in the client-side package.


## How to contribute to it
Contributions are started by first discussing with group members. Gitlab is used to monitor and manage the developmental environment. 
Here contributors can create issues that describe their contributions and can provide deadlines and assign to to themselves or to other contributors. 
Contributors can then create branches from master, and add their contributions. Once done, they create merge requests and wait for approvals
from other contributors. This process is repeated.
